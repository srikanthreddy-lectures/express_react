### Getting started
Just copy the source:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/srikanthreddy-lectures/express_react.git
```
Then run the following commands one by one:
```bash
cd express-react-template
npm i
```
You can start the dev server by running
```shell
npm run dev
```
This will fire up an Express server with live Webpack compilation and HMR.
Edit away!!

### Production
The process is pretty simple. First build the project:
```shell
npm run build
```
Then start the server with
```shell
npm start
```
That's all there is to it.
